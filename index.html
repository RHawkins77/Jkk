	Knitting has become a passion for me. My mother taught me how to knit when I was

very little and my grandmother taught me how to crochet. When I retired, I found that, if

I was sitting, I was knitting. As my inventory grew, I started selling my various

handmade items at Holiday bazaars and loved that others enjoy them, too. You can buy

the items you see on the website, and, given sufficient time, I will a take specific orders.
